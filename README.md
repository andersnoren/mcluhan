# McLuhan

McLuhan is a clean, simple and lightweight WordPress theme, featuring a front page with a complete post archive arranged by year rather than a traditional blog flow. It also sports fully customizable background colors for the sidebar and content, Block Editor/Gutenberg support, a responsive design, social network links with icons, an AJAX-powered mobile search with instant results, a resume page template and a full-width template.

## Contributing
Do you have a bug report or feature request? Feel free to create an issue, and I’ll take a look at it. You can also create a pull request if you have a solution ready. 

Keep in mind that I maintain my themes in my spare time. Even though I deeply appreciate any and all contributions, I can’t guarantee I’ll take a look at them quickly.
